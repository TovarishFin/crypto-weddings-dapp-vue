## todos
* setup ethers
* create basic user wallet using mnemonics and no metamask

## Notes
what does the user flow look like?
  we are going to need to:
    * check local storage for ENCRYPTED wallet data
    * restore if exists (with password for decryption)
    * prompt to create if none exists
    * prompt to create if none exists

how do we want to kick off this process?
  on wallet page load?
  on check for local storage?
