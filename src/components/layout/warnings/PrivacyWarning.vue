      You are about to store personal data on the blockchain!
    </p>
    <p>This information can never be removed!</p>
    <p>
      Think carefully about the account that you are using and where the funds
      came from! People will be able to trace the names that you are giving to
      these accounts now.

      If you have concerns over privacy and possibly your other ethereum
      accounts, consider using a coin mixer.

      If you are uncomfortable using real names, consider using pseudonyms.

      No one can remove this personal data that you are about to write to the
      blockchain. Not even you. That is the nature of blockchains.
