      Make sure to write down your mnemonic and keep it somewhere safe!
    </p>
    <p>This is your only way to restore your account later!</p>
    <p>There is no "I forgot my password option!"</p>
    <p>
      To copy your mnemonic, go the the text field labelled as "mnemonic" and
      click the clipboard icon. It looks like this:
      <br />
      <v-icon color="primary">mdi-content-copy</v-icon>
      <br />
      You will see a notification when it has been successfully copied to your
      clipboard.
    </p>
    <p>You can then paste it somewhere safe.</p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can click the "eye" icon on the right of the mnemonic
      field to view it and manually write it down. The icon looks like this:
      <br />
      <v-icon color="primary">mdi-eye</v-icon>
    </p>

      Do not transfer large amounts of ether to this wallet! Only transfer as
      much as you will need for the transactions.
    </p>
    <p>0.1 ether should be more than enough for everything you need to do.</p>
    <p class="warning--text font-weight-bold">
      Seriously, store the mnemonic somewhere safe. Did I mention that you
      should store your mnemonic somewhere safe?
